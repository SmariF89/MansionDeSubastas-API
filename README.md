# MansionDeSubastas-API
A Node.js web API implemented using Express. It offers routes to get or create artworks, artists, auctions, auction bids and customers. 

## Prerequisites
  Make sure to have Node and NPM installed.

## Start-up
  Using your favorite shell, browse to the root folder and enter:

  The project will get the required dependencies and run afterwards on localhost, port 3000.
  
## Usage
  **The connection string for the database is, for obvious reasons, not included in the repository. Feel free to contact me (smarifreyr30@gmail.com) to gain access to      the connection string.**
  
  Use any capable software you like, such as Postman, to create HTTP-requests to send to the running server.
  Please refer to the routes inside index.js to learn which routes are applicable.
